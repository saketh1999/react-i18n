# Internationalization (i18n) Learning Project

This project serves as a practical application for understanding and implementing internationalization (i18n).

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the core concepts of i18n, including:

-   **Resource Bundles:** Managing translated text in separate files.
-   **Locale Handling:** Dynamically switching between different languages.
-   **Formatting:** Adapting dates, numbers, and currencies to locale-specific formats.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of i18n principles and best practices. Through hands-on development, I aim to master the techniques required to build applications that can be easily adapted for multiple languages and regions.

## Technologies Used

-   Nextjs, React, i18n
